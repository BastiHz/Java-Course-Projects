## Simple Banking System

A console application that lets you open bank accounts and deposit or transfer money.
Card numbers are generated and validated with the 
[Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). The data are stored 
locally in an SQLite database file.

This very simple program was my introduction to SQL.
