## Car Sharing

A simple command line app that simulates a car sharing service. I used this 
project to repeat how to do SQL queries with JDBC.

First, create a company and add cars to it. Then create a customer, select 
a company and rent a car. You can inspect the rented cars and return them.
The data is stored in a local database file.
